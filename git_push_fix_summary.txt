# Git Push Authorization Fix - Summary

## Problem
- Getting "Permission denied" (403 error) when trying to push to GitHub from container
- Even though user was logged in with gh CLI, git push still failed

## Root Cause
- Container/VM didn't have proper SSH keys or git credentials configured
- GitHub CLI authentication wasn't properly linked to git operations

## Solution Steps

### Method 1: SSH Key Setup (Recommended)
1. Generate SSH key in container:
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com" -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -N ""

2. Start SSH agent and add key:
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

3. Copy public key:
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

4. Add public key to GitHub:
   - Go to https://github.com/settings/ssh/new
   - Paste the public key
   - Give it a title like "Container Key"

5. Switch git remote to SSH:
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:Maorb23/Vision_NLP.git

6. Test connection:
   ssh -T git@github.com

7. Push successfully:
   git push origin main

### Alternative Method: PAT with .netrc
1. Generate Personal Access Token on GitHub with "repo" scope
2. Create ~/.netrc file:
   cat > ~/.netrc <<EOF
   machine github.com
     login Maorb23
     password YOUR_PAT_HERE
   EOF
   chmod 600 ~/.netrc

### Alternative Method: GitHub CLI Integration
1. Setup git to use gh CLI:
   gh auth setup-git

## Key Learnings
- Container environments need their own authentication setup
- SSH keys are the most reliable method for container/VM git operations
- GitHub CLI login alone doesn't automatically configure git credentials
- Always test SSH connection before attempting to push
